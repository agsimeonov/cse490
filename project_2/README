CSE490 - Electornic Lock
The Design of this project is rather simple and closely related to the description found within the design project pdf.
The Lock has 3 states on power on Switch 0 should be lowered so that we can be in the unlocked stated UnLC.  
When lowered this switch indicates that the device is unlocked or that someone is attempting to unlock it.  
When raised the device will lock.  The default combination is 0000.  This combination can be changed when the device is in UnLC.
To change a combination simply hold each pushbutton until you arrive at the desired number combination.  When you raise switch 0
the device will then lock and proceed to stage LOC.  In this stage you can press each push button up to 25 times.  The combination
is still entered by holding down a push button.  each push counts as one press out of said 25 so try to hold until arriving at
desired combination rather then pressing continuously.  You will have 15 seconds to enter a combination after which you will have
to start entering the combination over again.  To attempt to use a combination to unlock move switch 0 downwards.  If correct the
device will unlock, if wrong the device will remain locked and you won't be able to enter a new combination until you  move switch 0
upwards again.  If you press the buttons 25 times the device will deactivate for 10 seconds and display PAUS.  After this the device
will go back to the locked state LOC again.
